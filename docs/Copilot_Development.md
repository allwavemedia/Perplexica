### **Step 1: Define the Scope and Objectives**
1. **Understand the Core Requirements:**
   - Enhance the application's search capabilities.
   - Implement "Copilot mode" for:
     - Query rephrasing.
     - Visiting relevant websites.
     - Extracting and presenting pertinent information.

2. **Determine Goals:**
   - Improve search efficiency and user experience.
   - Align the Copilot functionality with Perplexica's broader objectives.

---

### **Step 2: Review the Existing Architecture**
1. **Analyze Perplexica's Current Search Features:**
   - Review how queries are processed.
   - Identify gaps that Copilot mode would fill.

2. **Evaluate System Integration Points:**
   - Identify modules where Copilot functionality can be integrated.
   - Ensure compatibility with existing components.

---

### **Step 3: Plan the Technical Implementation**
1. **Identify Core Functionalities to Implement:**
   - **Query Rephrasing:** Natural language processing (NLP) techniques to improve query phrasing.
   - **Website Crawling:** Use web scraping or APIs to visit and extract relevant information.
   - **Information Extraction:** Leverage machine learning models to summarize and present the extracted data.

2. **Choose Tools and Technologies:**
   - NLP Frameworks (e.g., spaCy, Hugging Face).
   - Web scraping libraries (e.g., Beautiful Soup, Scrapy).
   - Summarization and information extraction models (e.g., GPT, T5).

3. **Design the User Interface (UI):**
   - Add a toggle for enabling "Copilot mode."
   - Provide a visually distinct representation of Copilot's assistance.

---

### **Step 4: Develop and Integrate Copilot Functionality**
1. **Build the Query Rephrasing Module:**
   - Integrate an NLP pipeline for analyzing and improving queries.
   - Train or fine-tune an existing language model if necessary.

2. **Develop the Web Interaction Module:**
   - Use APIs to access data from popular search engines.
   - Implement scraping capabilities where APIs aren't available.

3. **Create the Information Summarization Component:**
   - Use text summarization models to condense extracted information.
   - Focus on relevance and readability for the user.

4. **Integrate with Existing Search:**
   - Ensure seamless fallback to standard search functionality if Copilot mode is disabled.
   - Add error-handling and logging for Copilot processes.

---

### **Step 5: Testing and Validation**
1. **Unit Testing:**
   - Test individual components (query rephrasing, crawling, summarization).

2. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test the interaction between Copilot features and the core search module.

3. **User Testing:**
   - Gather feedback on Copilot functionality from a subset of Perplexica users.

4. **Performance Testing:**
   - Ensure that the new features do not degrade application performance.

---

### **Step 6: Document and Deploy**
1. **Documentation:**
   - Provide comprehensive documentation for the Copilot feature.
   - Include instructions for developers on maintaining and enhancing the feature.

2. **Deployment:**
   - Roll out the feature in a phased manner (e.g., beta testing).
   - Monitor usage and address issues post-deployment.

---

### **Step 7: Continuous Improvement**
1. **Monitor Feedback:**
   - Track how users interact with the feature.
   - Identify areas for refinement.

2. **Iterate and Enhance:**
   - Introduce advanced capabilities, such as context-aware suggestions or integration with knowledge bases.

3. **Keep Up with Trends:**
   - Stay updated with advancements in NLP and AI to keep the Copilot feature cutting-edge.
